Ion Xinerama module (based on the mod_xrandr skeleton)
by Thomas Themel <themel0r@wannabehacker.com>

INTRODUCTION

This module gives ion3 back its Xinerama support that was killed on 20070117.

INSTALLATION

        1. Edit Makefile to ensure TOPDIR points to your top-level ion source
           directory with a system.mk that matches the version of ion installed
           on your system.

        2. Run make.

        3. Either run (as root)
                # make install
           or (as yourself),
                $ mkdir -p ~/.ion3/lib
                $ cp .libs/mod_xinerama.* ~/.ion3/lib
        4. Add dopath("mod_xinerama") to ~/.ion3/cfg_ion.lua. See below
	   for possible status bar issues.
        5. (Re)start Ion.
		

LIMITATIONS

For some reason, loading the statusbar module _BEFORE_ the Xinerama module hides
the status bar. To work around this, load mod_xinerama before loading the
statusbar module.

This does not contain the Sun Xinerama support that was in the original ion3
because I don't have a machine running Solaris ready. Adding it should be rather
trivial with access to the original ion code and a Solaris machine.

WRAPPING goto_next_scr/goto_prev_scr

Without altering the ion3 source, it doesn't seem possible to get
goto_next_scr/goto_prev_scr to properly wrap around on the last/first screen.
This can be worked around in lua, though:

function next_wrap()
        scr = ioncore.goto_next_screen()
        if obj_is(scr, "WRootWin") then
                ioncore.goto_nth_screen(0)
        end
end

function prev_wrap() 
        scr = ioncore.goto_prev_screen()
        if obj_is(scr, "WRootWin") then
                ioncore.goto_nth_screen(-1)
        end
end
                       
defbindings("WScreen", {
    bdoc("Go to next/previous screen on multihead setup."),
    kpress(META.."Shift+comma", "prev_wrap()"),
    kpress(META.."Shift+period", "next_wrap()"),
})
