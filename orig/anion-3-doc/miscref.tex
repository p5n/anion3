\subsection{Size policies}
\label{sec:sizepolicies}

Some functions accept a \var{sizepolicy} parameter. The possible
values are: 

\begin{flushleft}
\codestr{default},
\codestr{full},
\codestr{full\_bounds},
\codestr{free},
\codestr{free\_glue},
\codestr{northwest},
\codestr{north},
\codestr{northeast},
\codestr{west},
\codestr{center},
\codestr{east},
\codestr{southwest},
\codestr{south},
\codestr{southeast},
\codestr{stretch\_top},
\codestr{stretch\_bottom},
\codestr{stretch\_left},
\codestr{stretch\_right},
\codestr{free\_glue\_northwest},
\codestr{free\_glue\_north},
\codestr{free\_glue\_northeast},
\codestr{free\_glue\_west},
\codestr{free\_glue\_center},
\codestr{free\_glue\_east},
\codestr{free\_glue\_southwest},
\codestr{free\_glue\_south}, and
\codestr{free\_glue\_southeast}.
\end{flushleft}

The ``free'' policies allow the managed
object to be moved around, whereas the other versions do not. 
The ``glue'' policies glue the object to some border, while allowing
it to be moved away from it by user action, but not automatically.
The ``stretch'' policies stretch the object along the given border,
while the coordinate-based policies simply place the object along 
that border.
