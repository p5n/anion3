This package contains some (advanced user and module writer)
documentation for the Ion window manager.

How to build:

 1. Get rubber <http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/>.
    Get Latex2HTML if you want HTML versions of the documents.

 2. Modify TOPDIR in Makefile point to your top-level Ion source
    directory, containing a working system.mk (or system-ac.mk).

 3. After the above has been done, you may run 'make all' to build all
    versions of the documents. You may have increase TeX pool size.
